# TM Property Price

Basic NodeJS App to automatically check the listed price for properties on TM. - Note: This app is slower than [@cheekyavo](https://github.com/cheekyavo/cheekyavo) app/extension. This is due to using puppeteer(headless chrome enviornment) to search for listings. The use of puppeteer allows us to avoid the current "Enable JavaScript to Continue" issue.
